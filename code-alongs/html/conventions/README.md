# HTML conventions

## Why do we need to follow code style conventions?

- Easier to read
- Make collaboration easier
- Tracking mistakes and bugs
- Maintanence/ making changes

## What are some universal "best practices" for writing HTML?

- Using semantics
- Indenting child elements
- Adding comments (if you're doing something different to normal practices)
- Use meaningful names for classes and ids (pick a convention e.g BEM)
- (debateable) use stylesheets over inline styles
- Always close tags
- lowercase tag names
- use the correct casing for classes and ids
