# Lists and Tables

## Why do we use these structured html elements?

- It might be easier to programatically generate content into a list or table
- It is also semantic for adapative technliogies

### Lists

- Lists of data may make semantic sense i.e ingredients in a recipe or steps in a guide

### Tables

- Sometimes it makes sense semantically for this content to be in a table
- Tables can be used for layout - although this is not commonly used anymore
  - In the early web days table layouts were pretty common
