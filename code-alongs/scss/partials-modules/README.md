# Partials & Modules

## What are they?

- Seperate files we can use to contain parts of our stylesheet

## Why do we use them?

- Maintainence - it's easier to work on a small tightly scoped file than a large one
- Avoid merge conflicts - particularly useful in collaborative work
- Mentally easier to work with small files
- It lends more towards a component based mindset - this is what frontend looks like these days
